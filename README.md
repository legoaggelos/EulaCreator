# EulaCreator
Automatically accepts the eula when creating a minecraft server.

Automatically accepts the eula when creating a minecraft server. Run this in your server folder before you create the server and it will automatically create the eula.txt file and accept the eula in it, so you don't have to do it manually. I made this project to practice working with files.

NOTE: THIS MAKES YOU AGREE TO THE EULA. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ IT.

Credits to bro code on youtube because I used his code for the LaunchPage class and modified it a bit.
